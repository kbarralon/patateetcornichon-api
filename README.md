# About

Patate & Cornichon is a website offering vegan recipes and articles on various topics such as
animal ethics, moral philiosophy, ecology, human sciences, etc.


Our goal is to propose simple alternatives to animal products, responsible for the iniquitous exploitation of animals and 
colossal environmental damage.

Also, beyond solutions, we want to suggest ways of thinking about our relationship to animals and raise awareness on 
issues related to injustices in general.

# Code
The code of Patate & Cornichon is freely accessible because there is no reason to keep it for us. We encourage the free
software movement and free technologies that are the foundation of our website.
